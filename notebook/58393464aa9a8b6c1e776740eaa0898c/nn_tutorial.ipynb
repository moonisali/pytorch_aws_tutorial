        "\nnn package\n==========\n\nWe\u2019ve redesigned the nn package, so that it\u2019s fully integrated with\nautograd. Let's review the changes.\n\n**Replace containers with autograd:**\n\n    You no longer have to use Containers like ``ConcatTable``, or modules like\n    ``CAddTable``, or use and debug with nngraph. We will seamlessly use\n    autograd to define our neural networks. For example,\n\n    * ``output = nn.CAddTable():forward({input1, input2})`` simply becomes\n      ``output = input1 + input2``\n    * ``output = nn.MulConstant(0.5):forward(input)`` simply becomes\n      ``output = input * 0.5``\n\n**State is no longer held in the module, but in the network graph:**\n\n    Using recurrent networks should be simpler because of this reason. If\n    you want to create a recurrent network, simply use the same Linear layer\n    multiple times, without having to think about sharing weights.\n\n    .. figure:: /_static/img/torch-nn-vs-pytorch-nn.png\n       :alt: torch-nn-vs-pytorch-nn\n\n       torch-nn-vs-pytorch-nn\n\n**Simplified debugging:**\n\n    Debugging is intuitive using Python\u2019s pdb debugger, and **the debugger\n    and stack traces stop at exactly where an error occurred.** What you see\n    is what you get.\n\nExample 1: ConvNet\n------------------\n\nLet\u2019s see how to create a small ConvNet.\n\nAll of your networks are derived from the base class ``nn.Module``:\n\n-  In the constructor, you declare all the layers you want to use.\n-  In the forward function, you define how your model is going to be\n   run, from input to output\n\n"
